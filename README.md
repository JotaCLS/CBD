# Data Base Complements

This repository contains study material for different database technologies.

## Lesson 1 - Jedis
The first lesson covers the use of **Jedis**, a Java library for interacting with **Redis**, a key-value NoSQL database. The focus is on understanding how to connect, perform read and write operations, and manage data in Redis.

## Lesson 2 - Mongo
The second lesson is dedicated to **MongoDB**, a document-oriented NoSQL database. We will explore installation, configuration, and CRUD operations using the **MongoDB Java Driver**.

In the third lesson, we study **Apache Cassandra**, a highly scalable NoSQL database designed to handle large volumes of distributed data. The lesson covers Cassandra's architecture, querying using **CQL** (Cassandra Query Language), and scalability practices.

## Lesson 4 - Neo4j
The fourth lesson explores **Neo4j**, a graph database. We will learn how to model and query graph data, with an emphasis on operations like path finding and analysis of complex networks.
